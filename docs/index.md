<h1>It's not you. Cross-chain swaps just suck.</h1>
<p>
Blockchains are more fragmented than ever.
</p>
<p>
Your money's never where you want it to be, when you need it to be.
</p>
<p>
Cross-chain swaps are slow, expensive and unreliable.
</p>
</p>
<h4>Imagine if you could securely swap native ETH for native SOL in seconds.</h4>
<p>
No more bridges, no more DEXs, no extra fees, just one transaction.
</p>
<h4>There's a better way. It has thousands of routes. And it's live right now.</h4>

<h2 class="first">What makes Mach different?</h2>

Mach provides a single interface on (nearly) every blockchain, providing swaps which are fast, cheap, and direct. 

Mach is exceptionally versatile, providing thousands of direct routes. While *Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)* are stuck on one chain, and *Bridges* can only move the same assets between chains, Mach creates efficient and secure swaps between **any asset** on **any chain** to **any other asset** on **any other chain**.

We seamlessly integrate with your favorite DEXs, CEXs, and bridges, all while providing one single, unified interface between chains.

Once a swap is initiated on chain, it is bonded and filled in one block on each chain, settling instantly for the user, and shortly-thereafter for the liquidity providers.

<h2 class="second">How is Mach secure?</h2>

Mach fills orders using an optimistic escrow system. Our open source challenger penalizes bad actors by seizing their collateral and completely refunding the user.

Liquidity pools are risky, slow, and capital inefficient. So Mach eliminates them entirely. Mach matches on-chain demand with off-chain supply, creating a safer and more efficient market for both parties.

Finally, our contracts are open source and audited.
